# ðŸ§® Experiment 08 â€“ Matrix Operations in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To write a C++ program to input two matrices from the user, display them, and perform their addition if dimensions match.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory  

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of elements in rows and columns.  
In C++, matrices can be implemented using **2D arrays** or **vectors**.  

Matrix addition is only possible when both matrices have the **same dimensions**.  
If two matrices `A` and `B` are both of size `m Ã— n`, their sum `C` is given by:
