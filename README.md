# ðŸ§® Experiment 08 â€“ Matrix Operations in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To write a C++ program to input two matrices from the user, display them, and perform their addition if dimensions match.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory  

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of elements in rows and columns.  
In C++, matrices can be implemented using **2D arrays** or **vectors**.  

Matrix addition is only possible when both matrices have the **same dimensions**.  
If two matrices `A` and `B` are both of size `m Ã— n`, their sum `C` is given by:

## ðŸ”„ Algorithm  

1. Start the program.  
2. Input the number of rows and columns for **Matrix 1**.  
3. Input the number of rows and columns for **Matrix 2**.  
4. Check if the dimensions of both matrices are equal.  
5. If dimensions are not equal, display a message and exit.  
6. Declare two 2D arrays to store the matrices.  
7. Input all elements of **Matrix 1** row by row.  
8. Input all elements of **Matrix 2** row by row.  
9. Create a 2D array for the **Sum Matrix**.  
10. For each position `(i, j)`, calculate:  
    ```
    Sum[i][j] = Matrix1[i][j] + Matrix2[i][j]
    ```  
11. Display **Matrix 1**.  
12. Display **Matrix 2**.  
13. Display the **Sum Matrix**.  
14. End the program.
